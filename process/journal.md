## Is this how you design a game poem? (2025-03-04)

Alright well I'm sitting here this afternoon looking out at fine snow and wondering how I would make a game poem. I'm referring to [Jordan's book](https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/2227ms45k?locale=en#/6/52[ch25]!/4/2[c18]/2/2/2[p147]/1:0). I'm referring to my own recently poetry writing in the Notes app on my phone, some of it incredibly distorted by autocorrect and my bleary typing in the early morning or late night. I'm referring myself to half-flashes of ideas I've had in the last couple of years, a snatch of a narrative device from Michigan: Report From Hell. Typing games.

I keep getting hung up on thinking about this as a game based on or featuring a poem, even though that isn't remotely what Jordan's book has to say about the idea of game poems. Mostly they're shortform games that are pointed in a different direction than, whatever, engagement and immersion. The kinds of things I usually make anyway?

I haven't looked at my Game Ideas list yet, I suppose I ought to... I'll paste a couple in here and see how that feels...

- That "Thoughts and prayers" game I was going to make as a follow-up to A Series of Gunshots (and related to Brian Moore's game in that vein), but I think it's simply too depressing to contemplate working on it
- Nothing? Something from the Nothings Suite? Expanding on that idea of emptiness? The zen koan of a game?
- Waiting minigames. I actually do like this one. "Wait for it!". One would literally just be a progress bar, but you could imagine lots of others... waiting for a pitch, waiting for the sword of damocles, and...... well other things right? How many would you need? How long would you wait?
- A ridiculously complex UI that makes poems
- Environmental Storytelling is one I've meant to make for a long time. Maybe I should make it. Though I think I was worried about the sheer number of audio nodes. I do like that project, it's funny and stupid.
- ...

Well there are games out there you know. It's funny to me how kind of derailing it is to think in terms of this ending up being a "poem" specifically which inescapable sucks some of the humour out, even though funny poems very much exist!

Of all of the above I think the waiting game is the funniest, but also probably the least poetic?

Uh... what am I even doing here. Working on a game poem? Doesn't feeeeeeeeeeel like iiiiiit!

I'll try again tomorrow?
